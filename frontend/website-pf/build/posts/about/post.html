Greetings friends and welcome to prestonfrazier.net! I built this website to serve as a potfolio for my projects 
and highlight some technical skills I aquired along the way. I plan to periodically add blog posts to this site regarding a
varitety of technology, science, and other topics. Hopefully some of them you will also find interesting.

Currently, I am a Senior Software Developer focusing in the area of health information technology. As a full stack developer,
I design many solutions using Amazon Web Services and serverless architectures. Some of my personal projects are detailed
on <a href="https://github.com/Prestonjf"" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and in my <a href="https://prestonfrazier.net/post/portfolio" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.

I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Central Michigan Univerity. While I enjoy software engineering,
I also have a passion for music, media, gaming, and design.
